And with that, Audu’s work became illegal, and his life was under threat.</p><p>Audu, who has a wife and two children, was an advocate for HIV patients, as well as for gay people in Abuja, the Nigerian capitol. Once the law was passed, Audu began to receive death threats. Within a month, Audu fled his home and family, arriving in the United States by February.</p><p>He already possessed a valid visa from prior speaking engagements at humanitarian conferences in Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. He also had connections in Chicago and New York who were able to help him get to New York City after he had arrived in Atlanta.</p><p>But in New York, Audu began to worry about how he was going to fit in to such a new and, for him, unusual place. He was anxious about his strong accent and whether people would be able to understand him. He wondered how he would survive in such a large and complex city.</p><p>And then there was his wife and daughters back in Nigeria. He did not know when he would see them again.</p><p>'When I came here and realized how long it will be before I see them again, it was an emotional experience for me,' he says. 'Even now, I am not alright because I miss them so much.'</p><p>Audu keeps moving and working. He is currently an intern at the Brooklyn Grange Rooftop Farm through a partnership with the Refugee and Immigrant Fund. At the end of September, when his internship ends, Audu is applying for jobs in public health and humanitarian services.</p><p>'I really am planning to relocate,' he says. 'New York is too busy for me. I was in Pittsburgh. I saw the serene and quiet. That is the kind of place I would like to be and bring up my children. But of course, this is New York and this is my first point of call. I want to get my two feet on the ground and then I can decide where I want to go.'</p><p>He has applied for asylum. As he waits, he tries to adjust to life in New York.</p><p>'Lagos is just like New York,' he says of Nigeria’s biggest city. 'The crowds and the traffic. The difference here is that things are well planned and organized, unlike in Lagos. This kind of life is too rough, but it is a good place to start. And hopefully, if I get my status— my asylum — I of course want my family to join me.'</p>",

Completely out of his comfort zone, he wrestled with isolation as he navigated a city foreign to him. At the same time, he felt an overwhelming feeling of relief for having fled communist China.</p><p>Here he has struggled, but he feels free.</p><p>Choy adapted to his new home by making Manhattan’s Chinatown his asset. In that neighborhood he was able to communicate in his native tongue and make the social and professional connections he needed to survive. He quickly got a job at a garment factory and worked seven days a week. Within a year, he says, Choy had saved up enough money to place a down payment on an apartment in Queens.</p><p>Adapting to change was not new to Choy. When he was 14, his world abruptly changed: His education came to a full stop and he was taken away from his family and told he must work on a farm for the rest of his life. This decision was one that neither he nor his family made. Instead, the People’s Republic of China mandated that one member of his family serve the communist regime. Such practices were common in his part of southern China in the 1960s.</p><p>Choy labored in the fields—year-round for nine years—until he was able to gather the resources to flee. His quest for freedom was far from simple. The first step entailed navigating the mountains to access the coast of China. The goal was to then swim through the night to reach the island of Hong Kong. But Choy was caught in the mountains by the government and was imprisoned for three months. Upon his release, he hatched a more methodical plan and, in 1975, he says, successfully made his way to Hong Kong, and from there to New York.</p><p>With each passing year, he says, parts of his grueling journey become hazy, but he clearly remembers select details. Hand stitching insulation into his swimming gear to prevent hypothermia, for example, and bringing a ball with him for the seven-hour swim, so he could float when his body gave out.</p><p>New York amazed him. He found the idea of processed food—orange juice in a box!—to be phenomenal. He went to an all-you-can-eat buffet and feasted on cake, something he had never tasted. But most of all, people of all classes could make choices about their lives.</p><p>He has since established strong roots here. His main advice to immigrants, refugees, and migrants alike is to be frugal. To fulfill the American dream, says Choy, you have to save money since you have no support system besides what is in your pocket.</p><p>It’s not that life was not a struggle in New York—Choy worked as a garment worker all his life. But Choy says there is one major difference: by coming to New York, he had the freedom to choose what he wanted to do with his life.</p>",

He would face prison time in Jamaica if the officials discovered he was gay. Jamaica’s anti-sodomy laws call for 10 years in prison and gay men can be convicted for public or private acts of intimacy whether or not sex is involved. The Human Rights Watch documented several anti-LGBT hate crimes in Jamaica, including the untried murder of a transgender woman who was beaten, stabbed and run over by a car for her gender and sexual identities. Martin said he watched other gay men get attacked and he said he was scared for his safety. 'I came to the U.S. to start over,' he added.</p><p>But his escape from the discrimination he faced at home didn’t end once he stepped out of the airport onto the streets of the city.</p><p>For six months, Martin lived on his tourist visa, which meant he couldn’t qualify for any form of government assistance or work legally.</p><p>To pay his rent and buy groceries, he said he started working under the table as a cook at a Jamaican restaurant. The other employees were also Jamaican, but Martin said they had the same prejudices against him that he had tried to leave behind. He said they harassed him relentlessly when they found out he was gay.  After five months, he decided to quit his job.  A month later, his tourist visa expired and he started his application for asylum.</p><p>As he started to fill out paperwork that required a permanent address and other personal information, but he moved out of his Brooklyn apartment because he said his roommates didn’t want his boyfriend to spend the night. He moved to the Bronx to an apartment already shared with others who were seeking government aid.</p><p>Still, his application was accepted relatively quickly – just 13 months after he submitted his papers Martin was granted asylum.</p><p>In his new home in the Bronx, Martin was finally able to be himself. He maintains the salad bar in a restaurant near Union Square, where he works on the books with the work permit he was granted when he received asylum. When he isn’t working, he spends his time with friends, his partner and other immigrants where they share their new experiences in New York.</p><p>'Being in America, free to express yourself, it’s a great thing,' he said.</p>",

His two children, his son, Tenzin Bhakdo, 10, and daughter, Tenzin Dasel, 5, are fixated on their vanilla ice cream. When his daughter gets restless he cradles her in his arms as he tells the story of his journey, a journey that began at roughly his daughter’s age.</p><p>He was 6 years old, he says, when his father, sent him away to escape a lifetime of repression by the Chinese government. His grandfather brought him to India where, in 1985, he was enrolled in a Tibetan children’s school in Bangalore. These schools are associated with the Dalai Lama. Paljor spent life in Bangalore. He grew up at the school, had a job at a monastery, and married a Tibetan woman with whom he started a family. </p><p>Despite settling into life in India, Paljor says that elements of the oppression his family experienced in Tibet followed him to his new home.</p><p>'Although the Indian government has been really helpful to the Tibetans, there are all these hidden issues,' Paljor said, 'There’s discrimination.'</p><p>The police, in particular, were a source of friction, especially when it came to their bureaucratic demands clashing with his work at a monastery.</p><p>'The tension escalated and I no longer felt safe,' he says. 'I lost my peace of mind.'</p> <p>Contact with his family was also difficult; he saw his father only once, 14 years after he was sent away. Paljor believed he could not return home. He was in college and unable to return to Tibet so his family met him on the border of Tibet and Nepal.</p><p>'It was really this kind of happiness and unhappiness,' he says. 'Members of my family were political prisoners in Tibet. Because of my family history, it would be very dangerous for me to return. I am afraid that if I return, I will be arrested on the spot,' Paljor says, 'Tibet is no life and there’s great risk staying in India.'</p><p>So Paljor decided to come America, leaving his wife and children behind. He arrived in New York in 2013 alone and with nothing. Finding work was difficult, without paperwork he could only get jobs that paid in cash. Paljor went to California and began seeking refugee status.</p><p>'This was the hardest part of my life, my family was still in Bangalore, I hadn’t seen them for almost two years, and I wasn’t getting approved. I was getting very desperate. I was out of control,' he says. 'Sometimes I would go to the (refugee) office and cry in front of everyone there.'</p><p>After months of trying, he returned to New York where, a week after his return he learned his application was approved. His family joined him in New York in July. </p><p>'That was my happiest day,' he says, 'seeing my kids and wife after two years, it was too long. '</p><p>Paljor is a cashier at a Trader Joe’s, a job he says he likes. His wife, however, has had trouble finding work and raising children in New York on one salary can be difficult.</p><p>And though he has his family with him, the scars of his early life remain. </p><p>'The most difficult part now is not being able to see my parents,' said Paljor.</p><p>His eyes are downcast as he fights to even his trembling voice, 'I don’t have any feelings for my parents. I don’t have any love for them because I didn’t get any affection from my parents. I was raised in that school; there was no parental support. When I am here in the U.S., I see the relationship between parents and children here is so deep, I didn’t get that…this is still the main disease that haunts me.'</p>",

As a monk in the Burmese town of Tachiliek his life was largely insulted from violence, even as tens of thousands of refugees passed through the town on their way to Thailand.</p><p>He is here not because he fled, but because he was needed. He was summoned by a community of Burmese refugees who had settled in Nashville, Tennessee. They found themselves in an alien world, cut off from their country and their religion. They were desperate for a teacher. Ashin was their salvation.</p><p>He claims his voyage to America was paid for by the Nashville group. They picked him up from the international airport on September 21st, 1982, and drove him to Truett Street on the eastern side of town. There, to his amazement, he says they had acquired a church. It was a hundred year old amphitheatre of a place, with a vaulted wooden ceiling and an excessive number of pews.</p><p>Ashin says he was provided with living quarters, adjoining the church in a compound. He disliked the snow and the darkness of winter. The food, though, he says was okay.  On Sunday evenings he held meditation classes for a small congregation of Thai and Burmese exiles. This was his expertise. It was the reason he came to America.</p><p>A monk’s life is spartan. From childhood Ashin has shaven his head. He wears only red ochre robes, unique to monks from Myanmar. He owns a pair of glasses, a razor, an alms bowl, and a basic needle and thread. He claims he had no difficulty in adjusting to his new life. He says that he has taught himself to endure every form of hardship. The meditation classes in the old church in Nashville only lasted a year. Ashin suggests that his friends ran out of money and that local Christians eventually reclaimed the space.</p><p>In early 1983, he decided to move to New York. The city had a larger Burmese refugee population. He hoped to establish a permanent sanctuary for meditation. He also wanted to improve his English. To ‘study the American people,’ he says. A subject he has always found curious.</p><p>In the 34 years since Ashin came to New York, the situation is Myanmar has worsened. His former home in Tachiliek has seen hundreds of thousands more refugees pass through on their way to Thailand. In 2007, 14,000 of those people were granted asylum in New York state. Welcoming them in Brooklyn has been the American Burma Buddhist Association. Ashin, the first Burmese monk in America, is its current residing Chief.</p> ",

Growing up in Hunts Point, part of the South Bronx congressional district that is the poorest in the U.S., she hasn’t had access to the best schools, she wishes she had more training in English, and her New York experience has been far removed from the version she saw depicted on television and in magazine in her native Liberia. But she is delighted to be here.</p> <p>Born in 1998—just before the outbreak of the second Liberian Civil War—Dolley’s memories of her home in Liberia are of existential fear and acute loss. Her early childhood took place against the backdrop of conflict, and her mother died when Dolley was six. Leaving her father behind, Dolley escaped Liberia during the war’s aftermath, fleeing with her uncle to Guinea. There, she says she was sent to school occasionally, but struggled due to her lack of French.</p><p>In 2006, Dolley and her uncle boarded a plane and flew to New York—to join Dolley’s father, who had already settled in the Bronx. Arriving at JFK, Dolley recalls being overwhelmed, 'The skyscrapers, I had heard of them, but I went to Manhattan, oh my God. It was like I was dreaming it was so beautiful.' This was in the spring, she notes, which was lucky because she had never had to deal with a New York winter.</p><p>Starting elementary school just three days after she arrived in the U.S., Dolley entered an ESL class. After only a month, she was told she had placed out of the class and was ‘mainstreamed,’ meaning she would receive instruction with the general student body. Lacking confidence in her English, Dolley struggled, 'Even now I’m still learning it, and I felt like I wasn’t ready.'</p><p>The people were different, too. 'Students here seemed really rude at first,' Dolley said. 'One kid threw a chair at the teacher and I was amazed. I thought the teacher was going to kill him, but the teachers here were nicer because they didn’t hit you.'</p><p>Despite the difficult adjustments, Dolley is thankful to be in the U.S. school system. In the mid-2000s, primary school fees in Liberia could cost up to USD $25 per term. For many families, Dolley’s included, such costs could be prohibitive. She remembers an uneven pattern of school attendance based on whether her family could afford the price. She assumed that paying for school in America would also be a problem. 'But I was excited because I had to pay in Africa, and here it was free.'</p><p>She found challenges in America, but was grateful to be here. 'The opportunities made me feel like it was worth it,' she said. 'I wanted to go school so bad.'</p><p>Dolley’s long-term plans involve Johns Hopkins University and cardiology, but first she has a goal for the summer after her senior year in America: 'I want to go back to Liberia next summer and open a library. That’s what I want to do.'</p>",

As it happened, the rebels, too, wore their hair in dreadlocks and Koroma was swept up in a mass arrest.</p><p>'We needed a revolution in Sierra Leone,' he says, 'but not a bloody, negative revolution.

He says that they walked more than 30 miles the first night. All were headed toward neighboring Guinea to seek asylum.</p><p>Having left with virtually nothing, and living in a refugee camp, Koroma and his wife turned, as they always had, to their music to sustain them. They made their own instruments out of anything they thought might replicate a real instrument. They made cymbals from hubcaps, drumsticks from sticks, drums from canisters and discarded barrels.</p><p>They made music and the people of the camp provided for them in exchange for the escape and the comfort he gave to them with his music.</p><p>They put voice to the suffering of the people and they sang songs of hope.</p><p>He remained in Guinea for more than five years.

(Listen to Rahman<a href=’https://soundcloud.com/cujournalismzrl/lockshin_shapiro-hoyt/s-uqlDq’> here</a>.)</p><p>But Rahman also sees New York as a place of opportunity. He says he feels good. He lives with his family in a one-bedroom apartment in Queens, his son is three years old now and in pre-Kindergarten classes, and in five months they’ll welcome a baby girl. She will be an American. Does he think people are different in America? Is it hard to adjust? He says that things are the same all over the world. People are the same all over the world. </p>",
