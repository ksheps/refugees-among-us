			"profile": "<p>In 1975, at 23, Ching-Fai Choy entered New York City with little money, no social connections, and zero knowledge of the English language. Completely out of his comfort zone, he wrestled with isolation as he navigated a city foreign to him. At the same time, he felt an overwhelming feeling of relief for having fled communist China.</p><p>Here he has struggled, but he feels free.</p><p>Choy adapted to his new home by making Manhattan’s Chinatown his asset. In that neighborhood he was able to communicate in his native tongue and make the social and professional connections he needed to survive. He quickly got a job at a garment factory and worked seven days a week. Within a year, he says, Choy had saved up enough money to place a down payment on an apartment in Queens.</p><p>Adapting to change was not new to Choy. When he was 14, his world abruptly changed: His education came to a full stop and he was taken away from his family and told he must work on a farm for the rest of his life. This decision was one that neither he nor his family made. Instead, the People’s Republic of China mandated that one member of his family serve the communist regime. Such practices were common in his part of southern China in the 1960s.</p><p>Choy labored in the fields—year-round for nine years—until he was able to gather the resources to flee. His quest for freedom was far from simple. The first step entailed navigating the mountains to access the coast of China. The goal was to then swim through the night to reach the island of Hong Kong. But Choy was caught in the mountains by the government and was imprisoned for three months. Upon his release, he hatched a more methodical plan and, in 1975, he says, successfully made his way to Hong Kong, and from there to New York.</p><p>With each passing year, he says, parts of his grueling journey become hazy, but he clearly remembers select details. Hand stitching insulation into his swimming gear to prevent hypothermia, for example, and bringing a ball with him for the seven-hour swim, so he could float when his body gave out.</p><p>New York amazed him. He found the idea of processed food—orange juice in a box!—to be phenomenal. He went to an all-you-can-eat buffet and feasted on cake, something he had never tasted. But most of all, people of all classes could make choices about their lives.</p><p>He has since established strong roots here. His main advice to immigrants, refugees, and migrants alike is to be frugal. To fulfill the American dream, says Choy, you have to save money since you have no support system besides what is in your pocket.</p><p>It’s not that life was not a struggle in New York—Choy worked as a garment worker all his life. But Choy says there is one major difference: by coming to New York, he had the freedom to choose what he wanted to do with his life.</p>",

		"profile": "<p>Tenzin Paljor, 46, sits outside the Starbucks on 46th  Street in Queens. His two children, his son, Tenzin Bhakdo, 10, and daughter, Tenzin Dasel, 5, are fixated on their vanilla ice cream. When his daughter gets restless he cradles her in his arms as he tells the story of his journey, a journey that began at roughly his daughter’s age.</p><p>He was 6 years old, he says, when his father, sent him away to escape a lifetime of repression by the Chinese government. His grandfather brought him to India where, in 1985, he was enrolled in a Tibetan children’s school in Bangalore. These schools are associated with the Dalai Lama. Paljor spent life in Bangalore. He grew up at the school, had a job at a monastery, and married a Tibetan woman with whom he started a family. </p><p>Despite settling into life in India, Paljor says that elements of the oppression his family experienced in Tibet followed him to his new home.</p><p>'Although the Indian government has been really helpful to the Tibetans, there are all these hidden issues,' Paljor said, 'There’s discrimination.'</p><p>The police, in particular, were a source of friction, especially when it came to their bureaucratic demands clashing with his work at a monastery.</p><p>'The tension escalated and I no longer felt safe,' he says. 'I lost my peace of mind.'</p> <p>Contact with his family was also difficult; he saw his father only once, 14 years after he was sent away. Paljor believed he could not return home. He was in college and unable to return to Tibet so his family met him on the border of Tibet and Nepal.</p><p>'It was really this kind of happiness and unhappiness,' he says. 'Members of my family were political prisoners in Tibet. Because of my family history, it would be very dangerous for me to return. I am afraid that if I return, I will be arrested on the spot,' Paljor says, 'Tibet is no life and there’s great risk staying in India.'</p><p>So Paljor decided to come America, leaving his wife and children behind. He arrived in New York in 2013 alone and with nothing. Finding work was difficult, without paperwork he could only get jobs that paid in cash. Paljor went to California and began seeking refugee status.</p><p>'This was the hardest part of my life, my family was still in Bangalore, I hadn’t seen them for almost two years, and I wasn’t getting approved. I was getting very desperate. I was out of control,' he says. 'Sometimes I would go to the (refugee) office and cry in front of everyone there.'</p><p>After months of trying, he returned to New York where, a week after his return he learned his application was approved. His family joined him in New York in July. </p><p>'That was my happiest day,' he says, 'seeing my kids and wife after two years, it was too long. '</p><p>Paljor is a cashier at a Trader Joe’s, a job he says he likes. His wife, however, has had trouble finding work and raising children in New York on one salary can be difficult.</p><p>And though he has his family with him, the scars of his early life remain. </p><p>'The most difficult part now is not being able to see my parents,' said Paljor.</p><p>His eyes are downcast as he fights to even his trembling voice, 'I don’t have any feelings for my parents. I don’t have any love for them because I didn’t get any affection from my parents. I was raised in that school; there was no parental support. When I am here in the U.S., I see the relationship between parents and children here is so deep, I didn’t get that…this is still the main disease that haunts me.'</p>",

His mother brought him to the United States at a time when Cambodia was being riven by civil war.</p><h3><p> 'We originally landed in Long Beach, California and for a few months we were trying to figure out where the refugee programs were. We came to realize a lot of the Catholic organizations and families were in Syracuse, New York but after a series of moves we ended up in Brooklyn when I was five years old. </p><p>'My mother spent most of her time trying to survive on food stamps, public assistance, and trying to find work. She didn’t know how to operate the public transport. My mother didn’t know the language and there was no type of ESL support. There was no one to help her navigate the system.</p><p>'Public assistance came and went pretty soon and it felt like we were by ourselves. Catholic organizations gave a small window of help and after that we were passed on to other Cambodian communities. But Cambodian communities are very tribal and they came and went too.</p><p>'My mom and stepfather were given just a few months to find work, and they had a caseworker, so this made it difficult to continue to be employed. The time that you weremeant to meet with the caseworker was during the day, but no one drove or had money to drive. If she didn’t show up you lost your food stamps benefits. There was no support and no empathy. There was no way you could survive.</p><p>'My stepfather was extremely abusive. [Refugees] arrive with trauma and a lot of people arrive with mental illnesses. There’s a lot of hurting each other, gambling and no resources to help people.'</p></h3><p>The family eventually settled in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Rahim went on to earn degrees at Oklahoma State University, Colorado Technical College and Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.  He is an Associate Professor at Bellevue University, in Nebraska.</p>",

'All communication, everything was cut.'</p><p>He recalls how the other children from his tribe, also unable to reach their families, decided to flee the city. 'The war started in the middle of the city,' he says. 'Imagine war starts in downtown Manhattan.  I go to school uptown, and my family lives in Brooklyn. There was no way I could reach them.'</p><p>He journeyed first, he says, to neighboring Ethiopia and then to Egypt, where he found his aunt, who had also fled. Eventually, the United States granted Adam refugee status. He was 16.  He was settled in Dallas, Texas, and eventually moved to Columbus, Ohio. He had no images of the people he left behind.</p><p>'I didn’t know how to speak English,' Adam recalls. 'It was very tough but I was very determined to succeed. I had to survive.'</p><p>The International Rescue Committee sponsored Adam for three months, after which he had to support himself. He got a job at McDonalds and also enrolled in college courses. 'I was working, going to community college, and saving a little money,' he says. 'And then I bought my first car. I really loved that car.'</p><p>After being accepted to Virginia Commonwealth University, Adam loaded up this car – a gold Subaru – and drove it from Columbus to Richmond.

In April 2014 he was able to bring his wife and two-year-old son to New York.</p><p>In many ways, Rahman is lucky. He arrived in New York as a Lawful Permanent Resident with legal authorization to work. He and his wife spoke fluent English and were able to stay with relatives in Queens while they got on their feet. They lived, and still live, in a neighborhood with a large Afghan community.</p><p>Rahman says the first few weeks were difficult. He had to run the gauntlet of applying for benefits, a bank account, an apartment, and a job. It seemed as if each application required him to already have the others in place already, he said. 'You’re looking for housing and a job and everybody is asking for money, asking, ‘Do you have a job? Do you have money?’ That was really hard. It still is really hard here. You have to work ten hours a day, six days a week. It’s really hard. It’s not easy.'

He lives with his family in a one-bedroom apartment in Queens, his son is three years old now and in pre-Kindergarten classes, and in five months they’ll welcome a baby girl. She will be an American. Does he think people are different in America? Is it hard to adjust? He says that things are the same all over the world. People are the same all over the world. </p>",
